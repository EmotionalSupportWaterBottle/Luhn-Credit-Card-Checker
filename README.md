# Luhn-Credit-Card-Checker
I made this tool to test credit card number findings in assessments to verify the card numbers are true positives before putting them down as findings.

Usage:
1. Just download the raw file.
2. chmod +x ./Luhnchecker.py
3. ./Luhnchecker.py
4. Type in the credit card number, and it will return a result teling you if it is a legit card number or not.
